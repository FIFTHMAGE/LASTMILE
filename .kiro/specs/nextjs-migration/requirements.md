# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing LastMile Delivery Platform from a separate Node.js/Express backend and React frontend architecture to a unified Next.js 14 TypeScript full-stack application. The migration aims to modernize the technology stack, improve developer experience, enhance performance, and simplify deployment while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Architecture Migration

**User Story:** As a development team, I want to migrate from separate backend/frontend to a unified Next.js 14 application, so that we can reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL run as a single Next.js 14 application on port 3000
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript throughout the entire codebase
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use Next.js App Router for routing
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN API routes SHALL be implemented using Next.js API routes instead of Express
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the same MongoDB database connection

### Requirement 2: Authentication System Preservation

**User Story:** As a user of the platform, I want all authentication features to work exactly as before, so that I can continue using the platform without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate using the same JWT-based authentication
2. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL support both business and rider registration flows
3. WHEN a user's email needs verification THEN the system SHALL send verification emails as before
4. WHEN a user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access control
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide the same error messages and handling

### Requirement 3: Business Logic Preservation

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want all existing features to work identically after migration, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a business creates an offer THEN the system SHALL store and process it with the same validation rules
2. WHEN a rider views offers THEN the system SHALL display offers with the same filtering and sorting capabilities
3. WHEN a rider accepts an offer THEN the system SHALL update offer status and notify relevant parties
4. WHEN payments are processed THEN the system SHALL handle transactions with the same security and validation
5. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL deliver them through the same channels and formats

### Requirement 4: User Interface Consistency

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the user interface to look and behave exactly the same after migration, so that I don't need to relearn the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access any page THEN the visual design SHALL be identical to the current React frontend
2. WHEN users interact with forms THEN the validation and error handling SHALL behave identically
3. WHEN users navigate between pages THEN the routing SHALL work seamlessly with Next.js App Router
4. WHEN users access role-specific dashboards THEN the content and functionality SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the performance SHALL be equal to or better than the current system

### Requirement 5: Data Model Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all existing data to remain accessible and functional after migration, so that no data is lost or corrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing MongoDB collections SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN data models are converted to TypeScript THEN they SHALL maintain the same schema validation
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL return the same results as the current system
4. WHEN data relationships are accessed THEN they SHALL function identically to the current implementation
5. WHEN database indexes are used THEN they SHALL provide the same performance characteristics

### Requirement 6: API Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer or API consumer, I want all API endpoints to function identically after migration, so that any external integrations continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return responses in the same format as the current Express API
2. WHEN API authentication is required THEN the same JWT token validation SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN they SHALL return the same error codes and messages
4. WHEN API rate limiting is applied THEN it SHALL use the same limits and behavior
5. WHEN API versioning is accessed THEN existing version endpoints SHALL continue to function

### Requirement 7: Development Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily set up and run the migrated application locally, so that I can develop and test efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL require only Node.js and npm/yarn
2. WHEN running the development server THEN it SHALL start with a single command and run on port 3000
3. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL be clearly documented and validated
4. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN they SHALL be compatible with the latest stable versions
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL provide clear feedback about the startup status

### Requirement 8: Testing Framework Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing tests to be migrated and continue passing, so that code quality and reliability are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are migrated THEN they SHALL cover the same functionality as the current test suite
2. WHEN API tests are run THEN they SHALL validate Next.js API routes instead of Express routes
3. WHEN component tests are run THEN they SHALL work with the new TypeScript components
4. WHEN integration tests are run THEN they SHALL validate end-to-end workflows in the Next.js environment
5. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL maintain or improve upon current coverage levels

### Requirement 9: Performance Requirements

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the migrated application to perform as well as or better than the current system, so that my user experience is not degraded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN they SHALL load in the same time or faster than the current system
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL respond within the same time limits as the current system
3. WHEN the application handles concurrent users THEN it SHALL support the same load capacity
4. WHEN static assets are served THEN they SHALL be optimized using Next.js built-in optimizations
5. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL maintain the same performance characteristics

### Requirement 10: Deployment and Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the migrated application to be easily deployable to production environments, so that deployment processes are simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built for production THEN it SHALL create optimized static and server assets
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL run as a single service instead of separate frontend/backend services
3. WHEN environment configuration is applied THEN it SHALL support the same environment variables as the current system
4. WHEN the application starts in production THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring
5. WHEN the application handles errors in production THEN it SHALL log them with the same detail level as the current system
